_Description: Remove the mail and news spools?
 The Cyrus mail and news spools, as well as users' sieve scripts,
 can be removed when the package is purged.
 .
 This question only applies to the default spools and sieve script
 directories in /var.  If you modified their location in imapd.conf, the
 new locations will not be removed; just the old ones in /var.
