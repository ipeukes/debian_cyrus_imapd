mboxtocyrus	A script to import mbox format mailboxes into Cyrus
		(by Michael-John Turner <mj@debian.org>

syncldap2cyrus.pl retrieves a list of usernames from an LDAP server and
                  then tries to create a user mailbox in Cyrus, and then
		  any secondary mailboxes under that. The idea is that
		  you could run this via cron or manually every time you
		  add a user to your LDAP server, and they would then
		  have a Cyrus mailbox. This script also has a report
		  mode that shows you any users in LDAP that do not have
		  a Cyrus mailbox, and vice versa.
