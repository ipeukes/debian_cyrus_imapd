# PAM configuration file for Cyrus SIEVE timsieved service
#
# If you want to use Cyrus in a setup where users don't have
# accounts on the local machine, you'll need to make sure
# you use something like pam_permit for account checking.
#
# Remember that SASL (and therefore Cyrus) accesses PAM 
# modules through saslauthd, and that SASL can only deal with
# plaintext passwords if PAM is used.
