.SH NAME
imapd.conf \- IMAP configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR
is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines
local parameters for IMAP.
.PP
Each line of the \fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file has the form
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR
.PP
where \fIoption\fR is the name of the configuration option being set
and \fIvalue\fR is the value that the configuration option is being
set to.
.PP
Although there is no limit to the length of a line, a ``\\''
(backslash) character may be used as the last character on a line to
force it to continue on the next one.  No additional whitespace is
inserted before or after the ``\\''.  Note that a line that is split
using ``\\'' character(s) is still considered a single line.
For example
.IP
\fIoption\fR:\\
.br
.in +1
\fIvalue\fR1 \fIvalue\fR2 \\
.br
.in +1
\fIvalue\fR3
.PP
is equivalent to
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR1 \fIvalue\fR2   \fIvalue\fR3
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.PP
For boolean and enumerated options, the values ``yes'', ``on'', ``t'',
``true'' and ``1'' turn the option on, the values ``no'', ``off'',
``f'', ``false'' and ``0'' turn the option off.
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
.PP
The sections below detail options that can be placed in the
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file, and show each option's default value.
Some options have no default value, these are listed with
``<no default>''.  Some options default to the empty string, these
are listed with ``<none>''.

.IP "\fBaddressbookprefix:\fR #addressbooks" 5
.RS 5
The prefix for the addressbook mailboxes hierarchies.  The hierarchy
delimiter will be automatically appended.  The public addressbook
hierarchy will be at the toplevel of the shared namespace.  A
user's personal calendar hierarchy will be a child of their Inbox. 
.RE
.IP "\fBadmins:\fR <empty string>" 5
.RS 5
The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
with a space.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use
separate "admin" instances.
.PP
Note that accounts used by users should not be administrators.
Administrative accounts should not receive mail.  That is, if user
"jbRo" is a user reading mail, he should not also be in the admins line.
Some problems may occur otherwise, most notably the ability of
administrators to create top-level mailboxes visible to users,
but not writable by users. 
.RE
.IP "\fBafspts_localrealms:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
The list of realms which are to be treated as local, and thus stripped
during identifier canonicalization (for the AFSPTS ptloader module).
This is different from loginrealms in that it occurs later in the
authorization process (as the user id is canonified for PTS lookup) 
.RE
.IP "\fBafspts_mycell:\fR <none>" 5
Cell to use for AFS PTS lookups.  Defaults to the local cell. 
.IP "\fBallowallsubscribe:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.  This option is
typically used on backend servers in a Murder so that users can
subscribe to mailboxes that don't reside on their "home" server.
This option can also be used as a workaround for IMAP clients which
don't play well with nonexistent or unselectable mailboxes (e.g.,
Microsoft Outlook). 
.RE
.IP "\fBallowanonymouslogin:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
Permit logins by the user "anonymous" using any password.  Also
allows use of the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism. 
.RE
.IP "\fBallowapop:\fR 1" 5
.RS 5
Allow use of the POP3 APOP authentication command.
.PP
Note that this command requires that SASL is compiled with APOP
support, that the plaintext passwords are available in a SASL auxprop
backend (e.g., sasldb), and that the system can provide enough entropy
(e.g., from /dev/urandom) to create a challenge in the banner. 
.RE
.IP "\fBallownewnews:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
Allow use of the NNTP NEWNEWS command.
.PP
Note that this is a very expensive command and should only be
enabled when absolutely necessary. 
.RE
.IP "\fBallowplaintext:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
If enabled, allows the use of cleartext passwords on the wire.
.PP
By default, the use of cleartext passwords requires a TLS/SSL
encryption layer to be negotiated prior to any cleartext
authentication mechanisms being advertised or allowed.  To require a
TLS/SSL encryption layer to be negotiated prior to ANY
authentication, see the \fItls_required\fR option. 
.RE
.IP "\fBallowusermoves:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
Allow moving user accounts (with associated meta-data) via RENAME
or XFER.
.PP
Note that measures should be taken to make sure that the user being
moved is not logged in, and cannot login during the move.  Failure
to do so may result in the user's meta-data (seen state,
subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date. 
.RE
.IP "\fBaltnamespace:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at the
same level in the hierarchy as INBOX.
.PP
This option ONLY applies where interaction takes place with the
client/user.  Currently this is limited to the IMAP protocol (imapd)
and Sieve scripts (lmtpd).  This option does NOT apply to admin tools
such as cyradm (admins ONLY), reconstruct, quota, etc., NOR does it
affect LMTP delivery of messages directly to mailboxes via
plus-addressing. 
.RE
.IP "\fBannotation_db:\fR twoskip" 5
The cyrusdb backend to use for mailbox annotations. 

Allowed values: \fIberkeley\fR, \fIberkeley-hash\fR, \fIskiplist\fR, \fItwoskip\fR
.IP "\fBannotation_db_path:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
The absolute path to the annotations db file.  If not specified,
will be confdir/annotations.db 
.RE
.IP "\fBanyoneuseracl:\fR 1" 5
.RS 5
Should non-admin users be allowed to set ACLs for the 'anyone'
user on their mailboxes?  In a large organization this can cause
support problems, but it's enabled by default. 
.RE
.IP "\fBannotation_allow_undefined:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
Allow clients to store values for entries which are not
* defined either by Cyrus or in the annotations_definitions
* file. 
.RE
.IP "\fBannotation_definitions:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
File containing external (third-party) annotation definitions.
.PP
Each line of the file specifies the properties of an annotation and
has the following form:
.IP
\fIname\fR, \fIscope\fR, \fIattrib-type\fR, \fIproxy-type\fR,
\fIattrib-names\fR, \fIacl\fR
.\"
.IP \fIname\fR 5
is the hierarchical name as in RFC 5257 or RFC 5464 (in the latter case,
without the leading \fB/shared\fR or \fB/private\fR).  For example,
/vendor/acme/blurdybloop.
.\"
.IP \fIscope\fR 5
specifies whether the annotation is for the \fBserver\fR, a
\fBmailbox\fR, or a \fBmessage\fR.
.\"
.IP \fIattrib-type\fR 5
.RS 5
specifies the attribute data type, which is used only to check the
string value passed by clients when setting annotations.  The
\fIattrib-type\fR is one of:
.\"
.IP \fBstring\fR 5
any value is accepted.
.\"
.IP \fBcontent-type\fR 5
this obsolete data type, which was useful for early drafts of the standard,
is accepted but silently translated to \fBstring\fR.
.\"
.IP \fBboolean\fR 5
only the strings "true" or "false" are accepted.  Checking is
case-insensitive but the value is forced to lowercase.
.\"
.IP \fBint\fR 5
integers are accepted.
.\"
.IP \fBuint\fR 5
non-negative integers are accepted.
.\"
.RE
.\"
.IP \fIproxy-type\fR 5
specifies whether this attribute is for the \fBbackend\fR or
\fBproxy\fR servers or both (\fBproxy_and_backend\fR)
.\"
.IP \fIattrib-names\fR 5
is the space-separated list of available attributes for the
annotation. Possible attribute names are \fBvalue.shared\fR,
\fBvalue.priv\fR, and \fBvalue\fR (which permits both \fBvalue.priv\fR
and \fBvalue.shared\fR).  The attribute names \fBsize\fR,
\fBsize.shared\fR, and \fBsize.priv\fR are accepted but ignored; these
attributes are automatically provided by the server if the corresponding
\fBvalue\fR attribute is specified.  Some obsolete attributes, which were
defined early drafts of the standard, are accepted and ignored with a
warning.
.\"
.IP \fIextra-permissions\fR 5
is the extra ACL permission bits required for setting this annotation, in
standard IMAP ACL permission bit string format.  Note that this is
in addition to the permission bits specified in RFC 5257 and RFC 5464,
so leaving this field empty is harmless.  Note also that there is no way
to specify that an annotation can only be set by an admin user; in
particular the \fBa\fP permission bit does not achieve this.
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

.RE
.IP "\fBannotation_callout:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
The pathname of a callout to be used to automatically add annotations
or flags to a message when it is appended to a mailbox.  The path can
be either an executable (including a script), or a UNIX domain
socket.  
.RE
.IP "\fBauditlog:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
Should cyrus output log entries for every action taken on a message
file or mailboxes list entry?  It's noisy so disabled by default, but
can be very useful for tracking down what happened if things look strange 
.RE
.IP "\fBauth_mech:\fR unix" 5
The authorization mechanism to use. 

Allowed values: \fIunix\fR, \fIpts\fR, \fIkrb\fR, \fIkrb5\fR
.IP "\fBautocreateinboxfolders:\fR <none>" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_inbox_folders\fR. 
.IP "\fBautocreatequota:\fR 0" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_quota\fR. 
.IP "\fBautocreatequotamsg:\fR -1" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_quota_messages\fR. 
.IP "\fBautosievefolders:\fR <none>" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_sieve_folders\fR. 
.IP "\fBgenerate_compiled_sieve_script:\fR <none>" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_sieve_script_compile\fR. 
.IP "\fBautocreate_sieve_compiled_script:\fR <none>" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_sieve_script_compiled\fR. 
.IP "\fBautosubscribeinboxfolders:\fR <none>" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_subscribe_folders\fR. 
.IP "\fBautosubscribesharedfolders:\fR <none>" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders\fR. 
.IP "\fBautosubscribe_all_sharedfolders:\fR 0" 5
Deprecated in favor of \fIautocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all\fR. 
.IP "\fBautocreate_inbox_folders:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
If a user does not have an INBOX already, and the INBOX is to be
created, create the list of folders in this setting as well.
.PP
INBOX folders are created under both the following conditions:
.\"
.IP 1.
The user logins via the IMAP or the POP3 protocol.
\fIautocreate_quota\fR option must have a value of zero or greater.
.IP 2.
A message arrives for the user through the \fIlmtpd(8)\fR.
\fIautocreate_post\fR option must be enabled.
.PP
\fIautocreate_inbox_folders\fR is a list of INBOX's subfolders
separated by a "|", that are automatically created by the server
under the previous two scenarios. Leading and trailing whitespace is
stripped, so "Junk | Trash" results in two folders: "Junk" and
"Trash". 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_post:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
If enabled, when \fIlmtpd(8)\fR receives an incoming mail for an
INBOX that does not exist, then the INBOX is automatically created
by \fIlmtpd(8)\fR and delivery of the message continues. 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_quota:\fR -1" 5
.RS 5
If set to a value of zero or higher, users have their INBOX folders
created upon a successful login event or upon \fIlmtpd(8)\fR
message delivery if \fIautocreate_post\fR is enabled, provided their
INBOX did not yet already exist.
.PP
The user's quota is set to the value if it is greater than zero,
otherwise the user has unlimited quota.
.PP
Note that quota is specified in kilobytes. 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_quota_messages:\fR -1" 5
.RS 5
If set to a value of zero or higher, users who have their INBOX
folders created upon a successful login event (see
\fIautocreate_quota\fR), or upon \fIlmtpd(8)\fR message delivery if
\fIautocreate_post\fR is enabled, receive the message quota
configured in this option.
.PP
The default of -1 disables assigning message quota.
.PP
For consistency with \fIautocreate_quota\fR, a value of zero is treated
as unlimited message quota, rather than a message quota of zero. 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_sieve_folders:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
A "|" separated list of subfolders of INBOX that will be
automatically created, if requested by a sieve filter, through the
"fileinto" action. The default is to create no folders
automatically.
.PP
Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each folder, so a
setting of "Junk | Trash" will create two folders: "Junk" and
"Trash". 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_sieve_script:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
The full path of a file that contains a sieve script. This script
automatically becomes a user's initial default sieve filter script.
.PP
When this option is not defined, no default sieve filter is created.
The file must be readable by the Cyrus daemon. 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_sieve_script_compile:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
If set to yes and no compiled sieve script file exists, the sieve script which is
compiled on the fly will be saved in the file name that autocreate_sieve_compiledscript
option points to. In order a compiled script to be generated, autocreate_sieve_script and
autocreate_sieve_compiledscript must have valid values 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_sieve_script_compiled:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
The full path of a file that contains a compiled in bytecode sieve script. This script
automatically becomes a user's initial default sieve filter script.  If this option is
not specified, or the filename doesn't exist then the script defined by
autocreate_sieve_script is compiled on the fly and installed as the user's default
sieve script 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_subscribe_folders:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
A list of folder names, separated by "|", that the users get automatically subscribed to,
when their INBOX is created. These folder names must have been included in the
autocreateinboxfolders option of the imapd.conf. 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
A list of shared folders (bulletin boards), separated by "|", that the users get
automatically subscribed to, after their INBOX is created. The shared folder must
have been created and the user must have the required permissions to get subscribed
to it. Otherwise, subscribing to the shared folder fails. 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all:\fR 0" 5
.RS 5
If set to yes, the user is automatically subscribed to all shared folders, one has permission
to subscribe to. 
.RE
.IP "\fBautocreate_users:\fR anyone" 5
.RS 5
A space separated list of users and/or groups that are allowed their INBOX to be
automatically created. 
.RE
.IP "\fBberkeley_cachesize:\fR 512" 5
.RS 5
Size (in kilobytes) of the shared memory buffer pool (cache) used
by the berkeley environment.  The minimum allowed value is 20.  The

environment. 
.RE
.IP "\fBberkeley_txns_max:\fR 100" 5

environment. 
.RE
.IP "\fBboundary_limit:\fR 1000" 5
.RS 5
messages are parsed recursively and a deep enough MIME structure
can cause a stack overflow.  Do not parse deeper than this many
layers of MIME structure.  The default of 1000 is much higher
than any sane message should have.

.RS 5
The latest date and time accepted by the server (ISO format).  This
value is also used for expanding non-terminating recurrence rules.

.IP "\fBexpunge_mode:\fR delayed" 5
.RS 5
The mode in which messages (and their corresponding cache entries)
are expunged.  "default" mode is the default behavior in which the
message files are purged at the time of the EXPUNGE, but index
and cache records are retained to facilitate QRESYNC.  In "delayed"
mode, the message files are also retained, allowing unexpunge to
rescue them.  In "immediate" mode, both the message files and the
index records are removed as soon as possible.  In all cases,
nothing will be finally purged until all other processes have
closed the mailbox to ensure they never see data disappear under
them.  In "default" or "delayed" mode, a later run of "cyr_expire"
will clean out the retained records (and possibly message files).
This reduces the amount of I/O that takes place at the time of
EXPUNGE and should result in greater responsiveness for the client,
especially when expunging a large number of messages.

Userid that is used for checking access controls when executing
Usenet control messages.  For instance, to allow articles to be
automatically deleted by cancel messages, give the "news" user

mailbox hierarchies. 
.RE
.IP "\fBnewspeer:\fR <none>" 5
.RS 5
A list of whitespace-separated news server specifications to which
articles should be fed.  Each server specification is a string of
the form [user[:pass]@]host[:port][/wildmat] where 'host' is the fully
qualified hostname of the server, 'port' is the port on which the
server is listening, 'user' and 'pass' are the authentication
credentials and 'wildmat' is a pattern that specifies which groups
should be fed.  If no 'port' is specified, port 119 is used.  If
no 'wildmat' is specified, all groups are fed.  If 'user' is specified
(even if empty), then the NNTP POST command will be used to feed
the article to the server, otherwise the IHAVE command will be
used.
.br
.sp
A '@' may be used in place of '!' in the wildmat to prevent feeding
articles cross-posted to the given group, otherwise cross-posted
articles are fed if any part of the wildmat matches.  For example,
the string "peer.example.com:*,!control.*,@local.*" would feed all
groups except control messages and local groups to
peer.example.com.  In the case of cross-posting to local groups,
these articles would not be fed.

The easiest way to think of it is a queue of past connections, with one
slot being filled for every connection, and one slot being cleared
